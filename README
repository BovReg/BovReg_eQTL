# BovReg_eQTL analysis
- This repository provide the nextflow scripts and demo data to test eQTL analysis and run with large datasets
- This workflow was developed as sub-workflow design to make the workflow distributable 
- This workflow was primarily developed for cattle (Bos Taurus), but it can adopted for any other species by changing the reference genome and gtf files
- User should have a linux environment with the lastest nextflow and docker installed to run these scripts.
- Care should be taken with the input and output paths while running with new data.
- The numbering of the scripts is the order in which the scripts should be executed with nextflow.
- To run a test analysis, demodata is available in the folder with the same name.
- The script 1,3 and 4 contain json files for calling parmaeters, whcih can run using the command 
        nextflow run script.nf -params-file file.json 
-All the software tools required for the pipeline are installed using docker container from  docker repositories, some other tools eg: QTLtools can be installed uisng the dockerfile present in the given folder
- To create the index for the reference genome the fasta and gtf file can be downloaded from
fasta: https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-109/fasta/bos_taurus/dna/Bos_taurus.ARS-UCD1.2.dna.toplevel.fa.gz
gtf: https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-109/gtf/bos_taurus/Bos_taurus.ARS-UCD1.2.109.gtf.gz

Demo data:
The genotype demodata is available "Demo_genotype_BovReg"
The Phenotype data (RNAseq expression data in fastq format) can be downloaded from research data open repository Zenodo  https://zenodo.org/record/7949616
The genotype-phenotype corresponding samples can be found in the text file "RNA_WGS_CorresID_BovReg.txt"
